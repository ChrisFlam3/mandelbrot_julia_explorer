# mandelbrot_julia_explorer

Mandelbrot&julia fractals explorer using GPU rendering loop and some tricks for double precision in GLSL shaders. Rendering pipeline was set up using SFML lib.

key mapping:

j for julia fractal

m for mandelbrot fractal

1 2 3 4 for julia transforming in x y

p for precision mode in julia fractal only

mouse scroll or + - for zoom

mouse panning for camera moving
